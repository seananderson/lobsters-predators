This repository contains analysis code for the paper:
S.A. Boudreau, S.C. Anderson, and B. Worm. Top-down and bottom-up forces interact at thermal range extremes on American lobster. In review at the Journal of Animal Ecology.

The raw datasets have been omitted from this repository since we do not have permission to share all of them. We have commented out code that refers to these raw data files. Instead the analysis in this repository starts with a processed dataset.

The analysis can be re-created by running the code in the file `r/README.R`.
